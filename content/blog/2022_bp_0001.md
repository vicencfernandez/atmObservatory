## Name

To provide global competence building programs for faculty.

## Description

BUPT places high emphasis on the capacity building, especially global competence building, of academic staff. Taking the year 2021 as an example, we organized five global competence/global competitiveness enhancement sessions for more than 150 faculty members, which involve more than 30 teaching hours each session, to equip our faculty members with relevant capabilities and communicative skills. We invited professors and experts from renowned universities around the world, as well as former officials at international organizations, to give lectures to our teachers. The five main themes of the sessions were: international competence, big data & social sciences, PBL teaching model theory and practice, intercultural communication and international research cooperation, and United Nations junior professionals (JPO) training. We also involved our faculty and staff in a wide range of other capacity building workshops and lectures, including the ones provided under the framework of the European Unionâ€™s aTM project.
