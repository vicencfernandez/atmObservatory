## Name

Management of job offers under agreement.

## Description

By setting up different levels of posts, specifying the corresponding duties and tasks of the posts, signing post assignment letters with the talents of the appropriate level, implementing the management of the appointment period, adopting the assessment mechanism of "mid-term reminder + end-of-term evaluation", and demoting or terminating the employment contract for talents who fail to complete their tasks. 

## Importance and/or impact of the best practice

The school will continue to develop a governance system that is "governed by law" by defining the tasks of the post in the form of an agreement and giving full play to the motivational role of post management.
