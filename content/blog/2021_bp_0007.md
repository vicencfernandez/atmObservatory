## Description

The Succession Planning carefully integrates the various training and development programs and activities into a source of reference for all skill and competencies need of UNIMAS.

## Importance and/or impact of the best practice

UNIMAS is born to adapt to changes. Our tagline - contemporary and forward looking - means that we cannot afford to be stagnant. In managing talents, we need not be constrained by conventional bureaucracy and traditions; instead, we should be strategically responsive to the ever-changing contexts. UNIMAS has long been a microcosm of our setting. As a university that is based in Sarawak, we naturally reflect the harmonious unity, inclusivity and broad-mindedness that Sarawak is known for. These values, already robustly sown in our community, are the assets that we will continuously nurture in our future leaders. 

And UNIMAS Succession Planning is to provide sufficient, multi-skilled talent pool for the Universityâ€™s succession plan and for future leadership strategies. UNIMAS aim to produce highly-competent workforce who are needed for the University to excel.
